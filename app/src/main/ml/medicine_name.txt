Apple scab: Use fungicides like Captan or Mancozeb during the early season to prevent fungal spores from infecting the tree. It’s important to apply before and after rain to protect new leaves.  
Apple black rot: Apply Captan or Copper-based fungicides to prevent infections. Prune infected limbs and remove fallen fruit to limit disease spread.  
Apple cedar apple rust: Prevent with Myclobutanil or Mancozeb, especially during spring when spores are released. Removing nearby cedar trees can also help reduce infections.  
Apple healthy: No treatment required.  
Blueberry healthy: No treatment required.  
Cherry (including sour) powdery mildew: Apply Sulfur or Potassium bicarbonate early in the season to manage the fungal infection. Ensure good air circulation around the plants to prevent mildew buildup.  
Cherry (including sour) healthy: No treatment required.  
Corn (maize) cercospora leaf spot/gray leaf spot: Use Strobilurin fungicides like Azoxystrobin during early symptoms to reduce leaf damage and prevent yield loss.  
Corn (maize) common rust: Control rust with Mancozeb or Propiconazole, applied when rust spots first appear on leaves.  
Corn (maize) northern leaf blight: Apply Triazole fungicides like Propiconazole when disease is first noticed to slow the spread of the blight.  
Corn (maize) healthy: No treatment required.  
Grape black rot: Use Captan or Myclobutanil as a preventive fungicide. Prune vines and remove diseased fruit to limit the spread of the fungus.  
Grape esca (black measles): There’s no cure, but Sodium arsenite (restricted use) can be applied to affected trunks. Alternatively, trunk surgery to remove infected wood may help limit disease progression.  
Grape leaf blight (Isariopsis leaf spot): Apply Mancozeb or Copper-based fungicides to manage leaf blight. Ensure vines have good air circulation to reduce moisture buildup.  
Grape healthy: No treatment required.  
Orange Huanglongbing (citrus greening): There is no cure. Focus on controlling the vector (Asian citrus psyllid) with insecticides and removing infected trees to protect the rest of the orchard.  
Peach bacterial spot: Use Copper-based fungicides or Oxytetracycline to manage bacterial infections, especially in wet conditions.  
Peach healthy: No treatment required.  
Pepper bell bacterial spot: Use Copper-based fungicides and Streptomycin to prevent and manage the bacterial disease. Remove infected plants to limit spread.  
Pepper bell healthy: No treatment required.  
Potato early blight: Apply Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb at the first sign of symptoms to prevent defoliation and yield loss.  
Potato late blight: Use Copper-based fungicides or Mancozeb to control the spread of late blight. Early treatment is key to prevent significant damage.  
Potato healthy: No treatment required.  
Raspberry healthy: No treatment required.  
Soybean healthy: No treatment required.  
Squash powdery mildew: Use Sulfur or Potassium bicarbonate to manage powdery mildew, particularly in humid conditions. Improve air circulation around plants.  
Strawberry leaf scorch: Captan or Copper-based fungicides can help manage this fungal disease. Remove affected leaves to limit spread.  
Strawberry healthy: No treatment required.  
Tomato bacterial spot: Use Copper-based fungicides or Streptomycin to manage bacterial infections. Remove infected plants to avoid spread.  
Tomato early blight: Apply Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil early in the growing season to prevent severe defoliation.  
Tomato late blight: Use Copper-based fungicides or Mancozeb to protect plants during wet conditions when late blight is likely to spread.  
Tomato leaf mold: Control with Chlorothalonil or Copper-based fungicides, especially in greenhouses where humidity is high.  
Tomato septoria leaf spot: Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil should be applied at the first signs of leaf spots to prevent defoliation.  
Tomato spider mites (two-spotted spider mite): Use Abamectin or Horticultural oil to control mite populations, focusing on the underside of leaves.  
Tomato target spot: Apply Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb when spots first appear to manage the disease.  
Tomato yellow leaf curl virus: There is no cure, but controlling whitefly populations (the vectors) is essential to prevent spread.  
Tomato mosaic virus: No cure, but planting virus-free seeds and avoiding mechanical transmission can help limit the disease.  
Tomato healthy: No treatment required.
